<h1>One-dimensional Maps</h1>

<h3>objectives</h3>
<p>The web app uses the Google Directions API to calculate walking directions, format the results and send them to a printer.</p>

*future development:*
 
- use D3.js to draw a vertical scale which includes the turning points
- the points and labels need to be spaced according to the distances, thereby generating a one-dimensional map
- use the Cyclestreets API instead of Google Directions

<h3>Technologies used:</h3>
- JavaScript
- Google Directions API
- HTML5/CSS, Google Fonts, <a href="http://www.colourlovers.com/">ColourLovers</a>
