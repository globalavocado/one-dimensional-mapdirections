# one-dimensional maps

## objectives
This web application uses the Google Maps Directions API to calculate walking directions, then formats the results and can send them to a printer. Eventually it will also be able to generate a one-dimensional map.

_wish list:_
 
- draw a vertical scale which includes the turning points, where the points and labels are spaced according to the distances, thereby generating a one-dimensional map
- use the Cyclestreets API instead of Google Directions
- prevent the print window from closing when the print preview is closed (Firefox and Chrome)

## technologies used:
- JavaScript
- Google Map Directions API
- HTML/CSS, Google Fonts, [ColourLovers palettes](https://www.colourlovers.com)

## instructions

You will need your own Google API key for this app to work. Once you have generated one as per these [instructions](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/directions#GetStarted), search for YOUR_API_KEY in _googledirections.html_ and replace it with your own.
